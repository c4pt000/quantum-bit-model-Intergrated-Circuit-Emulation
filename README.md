quantum go model qbit model

todo -> to refine this idea, was just drawn quickly,
( a thought model for the standard computing "die" to show the states of on/off at the same time , on/on, off/off, and the superposition to model quantum computing through standard over the counter electronics using opto-isolators and mosfets, to retain the position of ON and OFF at the same time as the Qubit model allows)

other thoughts at the IC die level, outside of representation for the game of Go and modification
