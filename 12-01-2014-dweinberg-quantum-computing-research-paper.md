“Science’s challenge to build a quantum computer”
In the late 1940s the first electronic computers used switches, vacuum tubes and later punch 
cards to process and compute data. As technology progressed the concept of a working computer
 began to grow. Computers started using transistors a type of switch which were packed into 
integrated circuits. With the advancement in integrated circuits computers were able to use more 
and more transistors to process data.  Ever since the late 1940s with the invention of the first 
working electronic computer and as computers started to progress in terms of speed and power, 
scientists and physicists started to fathom quantum computers as both thought experiments and 
pseudo mathematical models. Concepts began to emerge, things like quantum computers, 
quantum encryption, and adiabatic quantum computation slowly started to form. Using special 
properties applied in physics scientists began to ponder how this would possibly affect 
computers in the field of computer science. Some ideas were modelled from theories like 
Schrödinger’s cat and how particles might behave in a state of entanglement.  This presented a 
challenge to scientists due to the difficulties to register a binary switch as on and off at the same 
time to process data. Normally computers process information with binary data which is 
represented as either on or off in a single bit. Even though they were presented with this 
challenge they continued to argue these ideas as thought experiments through the 80s and 90s. 
Quantum computing is now more within the reach of scientists than it was decades ago.  Semi 
working prototypes for quantum computing began to emerge from universities and companies. 
These semi working prototypes are able to perform the most basic quantum computing 
applications. Quantum computers will allow researchers and scientists to solve many complex 
problems in science and to draft and design new scientific tools.  In any case quantum computers 
could present a lot of new problems. Classical computing standards might become obsolete. In 
any event computing technology is on the verge of a new era. Quantum computers will solve 
problems with artificial intelligence, medicine, physics, and space but it might create more 
problems in terms of how information is secured.
Quantum computers will be able to solve sets of data in a shorter duration than classical 
computers working on the same sets of data because quantum computers are more efficient. 
Quantum computers use qubits to process information unlike classical computers which use bits. 
Normally, classical computers or today’s standard computers process information using bits and 
a bit is represented by either a 1 or 0 which is either on or off. In the article “The CIA and Jeff 
Bezos Bet on Quantum Computing" written by Tom Simonite, Tom explains “The qubits enter a 
quantum state where they are simultaneously 1 and 0, like Schrödinger’s cat being both dead and 
alive, and lock into a strange synchronicity known as entanglement.” (Simonite 9)  A qubit is 
basically like a bit but the special property of a qubit allows it to represent data as 0 or 1 or 0 and 
1 at the same time in a state known as a superposition.  Quantum computers differ than classical 
computing because quantum computers use qubits to process data. In theory the more qubits the 
quantum computer has the more values it can represent. In the article “Riding D-wave”, Seth 
Lloyd writes “Since one qubit can simultaneously represent two different values, two qubits can 
simultaneously represent four (00, 01, 10, and 11, in binary notation); four qubits can represent 
16 values; eight qubits 256 values; and so on.” (Lloyd 5) If more qubits are added to a quantum 
computer the quantum computer can represent more values. In the article “Breaking D-Wave”, 
Alex Hutchinson writes “This is where the remarkable power of quantum computers resides, and 
it increases exponentially if you combine qubits together: a group of just sixteen qubits can 
represent 65,536 different numbers simultaneously.” (Hutchinson 10) In contrast a classical 
computing system using 16 bits does not operate the same as a quantum computer using 16 
qubits because of the differences between a bit and a qubit. Quantum computers solve data 
differently than classical computers and they solve the data more efficiently. Scientists are using 
working prototypes of quantum computers from a company called D-wave to solve sets of data 
and they can work on scientific problems that would be impossible for standard computers. In 
the Article “Computing: The quantum company”, Nicola Jones writes “Meanwhile, Lockheed 
Martin researchers have developed an algorithm that allows D-Wave machines to tell whether a 
piece of software code is bug-free — something that, they note, is impossible with classical 
computers.” (Jones 26) Scientists using the quantum computers from D-wave can also solve the 
data in less time if it is optimized to do so. Nicola Jones also explains that following from the 
article “Computing: The quantum company”. “McGeoch found that in the optimization-
type problems that the D-Wave was designed to solve, it came up with the right answers in half a 
second, compared with 30 minutes for a top-level IBM machine.”  (Jones 27) Quantum 
computers offer a lot of different advantages when compared to standard classical computing. 
They solve problems differently than classical computers using qubits and this is what gives 
quantum computing its advantage. In theory another problem that quantum computers can do 
more efficiently than classical computers is the ability to factor large numbers.  In the 
article "Breaking D-Wave" Alex Hutchinson mentions “However you think about it, the result is 
a computer that can do things that were previously impossible, such as factoring huge numbers 
quickly.” (Hutchinson 12) Classical computers aren’t powerful enough to factor large numbers 
quickly and a lot of today’s codes and encryption depends on large numbers. Quantum 
computers offer the ability to tackle a lot of different scientific problems that standard classical 
computers aren’t capable of handling due to limitations in the way that they process information 
and problems that are presently impossible to solve with classical computing.
    Even though quantum computers will solve a lot of problems there are issues with the 
misuse of technology in general. The NSA is racing to try and fulfill the need for a quantum 
computer and companies like D-Wave and Google are primarily experimenting on prototypes. 
Nevertheless if the NSA starts using quantum computers who is to say that they might not abuse 
this technology. In the past agencies like the NSA and FBI have tainted or have tried to taint 
mechanisms in standard classical computers which violate user privacy. Even though 
organizations that have tried to taint standard classical computers argue that it is for security it is 
still an abuse of technology. There are a lot of examples of this from various companies and 
organizations. In the article “Spying is bad for business”  Antonio Regalado writes “After all, 
the Snowden documents suggest how vigorously the NSA worked to insert back doors in gear, 
software, and undersea cables--in some cases via what the agency called "sensitive, cooperative 
relationships with specific industry partners" identified by code names.” (Regalado 12) Aside 
from the NSA or FBI putting backdoors or loopholes into classical computing mechanisms who 
is to say that hackers or rouge radical groups could exploit this technology. In a lot of cases with 
classical computing hackers have compromised data from credit card companies and major chain 
stores and have also gathered millions of user passwords from popular email providers. In 
any case there seems to be problems when innovative technology is drafted by scientists. These 
are just some example of many countless examples of misuses of technology. Sure quantum 
computers will solve a lot of problems and solve data more efficiently but there should be 
protocols and safeguards in place so that the technology isn’t misused.
Using an algorithm like Shor’s algorithm on a quantum computer would allow the 
quantum computer to conduct unparalleled code breaking. An algorithm is basically a 
mathematical set of instructions for performing an operation almost the way a recipe is used 
when someone is cooking something. Shor’s algorithm running on a quantum computer would 
factor large numbers quickly and this would allow for breaking codes since most codes are 
protected with large numbers. Seth Lloyd explains in his article “Riding D-wave” , “Even a 
relatively small quantum computer, one that had a few tens of thousands of qubits, could 
consider so many different values at once that it would be able to break all known codes 
commonly used for secure Internet communication.” (Lloyd 5) This might be one of the reasons 
why the NSA is interested in a working quantum computer. Whether it’s to break into systems 
that are using encryption that hide information or whether it will be used to harden current 
encryption means by using quantum encryption.  Seth Lloyd also comments in his article 
“Riding D-wave”. “Given their power to intercept and disrupt secret communications, it is not 
surprising that quantum computers have the attention of various U.S. government agencies.” 
(Lloyd 6) Encryption is basically a digital means of protecting information like a lock and a key. 
A lot of different things depend on encryption in today’s digital world. Sometimes there are 
flaws in the way something is protected with encryption and the encryption can be cracked.  
Lamont Wood thinks the following in his article “The clock is ticking for Encryption”. ”That's 
the case today. But within the foreseeable future, cracking those same codes could become 
trivial, thanks to quantum computing.” (Wood 4) The special properties in which a quantum 
computer operate would allow it to crack codes very quickly if it were optimized and 
programmed to do so. Alex Hutchinson writes in his article "Breaking D-Wave" the following 
“Cracking a code is essentially like trying to guess a number between one and a trillion (the 
harder the code, the bigger the number). While a classical computer would have to try each 
number in succession until it found the right one, a quantum computer could try all the numbers 
at once.” (Hutchinson 11) If the NSA had a working quantum computer they would basically be 
able to bypass almost any type of digital protection that uses encryption. They would be able to 
decrypt e-mail even if it was protected with PGP or AES encryption. Alex Hutchinson also 
mentions in his article "Breaking D-Wave" . “Shor's algorithm had immediate implications for 
the NSA. Not only is it interested in "reading Osama's email," as some researchers put it, but it 
has to ensure that encrypted US government communications can't be decoded down the road by 
yet-to-be-invented technology. “ (Hutchinson 5) Aside from being able to decrypt and crack 
encryption efficiently quantum computers offer more secure encryption with a type of encryption 
called quantum encryption. The differences between standard encryption and quantum 
encryption are basically as follows. Since classical computers use 1 or 0 to encrypt data and 
quantum computers can use 1 and 0 at the same time information can be encrypted in a state of 
entanglement where even if there is a third party eavesdropping on a communication the 
communication cannot be decrypted. So aside from being able to crack and decrypt codes easily 
used by classical computers quantum computers also offer a better form of encrypting and 
protecting data using quantum encryption.
    Scientists will be able to make powerful simulations to model drugs for medicine or to 
solve other difficult challenges in the field of science using quantum computers. Aside from 
using quantum computers to develop quantum encryption and to break current encryption 
standards used by classical computers today quantum computers will be used to make powerful 
models using simulations that outperform simulations that are used by classical computers today. 
In the article “Riding D-Wave" Seth Lloyd writes “In 1996, I showed that Feynman was correct 
and created algorithms that would allow a quantum computer to simulate solid-state, chemical, 
and high-energy systems. Such a simulator would require only a hundred qubits or so to be able 
to surpass all conventional supercomputers.” (Lloyd 8) Using these types of applications 
scientists will be able to model drugs for medicine more accurately because they will be able to 
see how the changes to some of the molecules will respond. Alex Hutchinson in his article 
“Breaking D-wave” comments “The most radical application for quantum computers is 
something called quantum simulation. If you wanted to know whether a certain complicated 
molecule would make a good drug, you could, in theory, solve the quantum-mechanical 
equations that govern the motion of all the electrons and protons and other components of the 
molecule, which would tell you exactly how it will behave.” (Hutchinson 13)  Hutchinson thinks 
the following about quantum simulations using quantum computers. “If the computer is powerful 
enough, it could model just about anything in the universe.” (Hutchinson 13) Not only will 
scientists be able to model drugs for medicine more accurately they will have a better 
understanding of what goes on with protein folding. Some scientists are already using working 
prototypes from D-wave to get more accurate results when they analyze data on protein folding. 
In the article written by Nicola Jones “Computing: The Quantum Company” Jones points out the 
following “In 2012, researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, used a D-
Wave machine to find the lowest-energy folding configuration for a protein with six amino acids. 
They did not have enough qubits to code the problem properly, but even so, on a problem that no 
other quantum computer could touch, the D-Wave machine found the best solution 13 times out 
of 10,000 runs.” (Jones 25) Quantum computers can be used for better image recognition  
and image recognition is used in a lot of different fields. Using this basic form of Artificial 
Intelligence computers can analyze photographs for important anomalies that can be crucial 
for making decisions. Nicola Jones explains in the article “Computing: The Quantum Company” 
that Google is experimenting with this technology using D-wave systems. “In 2009, for example, 
a Google research team developed a D-Wave algorithm that could learn to judge whether or not a 
photo showed a car — an example of a ‘binary image classifier’ that could in principle be used to 
tell whether a medical image shows a tumor, or a security scan shows a bomb.” (Jones 24) 
Overall quantum computers will allow scientists to solve a lot of daunting problems in different 
fields of science.
Quantum computers are being developed by D-wave and Google with funding from some 
organizations like the NSA and NASA. As I have been explaining in this article it seems like 
quantum computers have moved out of theory into working prototypes. For a couple of decades 
scientists have been theorizing about how a quantum computer would operate and the kinds of 
problems that it would be able to solve.  Some companies have been talking about prototypes for 
a working quantum computer and it seems like the company D-wave has a working prototype of 
a quantum computer. At first some critiques thought that D-wave’s prototype was a hoax. The 
idea that D-wave has a working prototype is still argued by some scientists and it is being 
debunked more and more. Nicola Jones writes the following about D-wave in the article 
“Computing: The Quantum Company”.  “After initial disbelief and ridicule from the research 
community, Rose and his firm are now being taken more seriously — not least by aerospace 
giant Lockheed Martin, which bought one of D-Wave’s computers in 2011 for about US$10 
million, and Internet behemoth Google, which acquired one in May.” (Jones 2) So it seems that 
D-wave is becoming less of a myth about whether or not they have a working prototype. Nicola 
Jones also mentions in the article “Computing: The Quantum Company” the following “The 
problem of lack of recognition is fast disappearing for D-Wave, the world’s first and so far only 
company making quantum computers.” (Jones 2) The NSA has had an interest in quantum 
computing also from a few decades ago. In the article written by Alex Hutchinson “Breaking D-
wave” Hutchinson writes “The motto of the United States's National Security Agency (NSA), 
etched in a plaque across the road from the spy agency's sprawling headquarters off Route 295 in 
Maryland, is "Always out front." In the world of modern military intelligence, that primarily 
means staying ahead of rivals in the race for innovative technology to help monitor, decrypt, and 
analyze surveillance data. This need is the engine that has driven quantum-computing research 
since 1994, when then AT&T computer scientist Peter Shor made an unexpected discovery.” 
(Hutchinson 5) Since the NSA has had an interest in quantum computers they along with other 
agencies have been trying to fund research for quantum computers. Hutchinson also explains the 
following in the article “Breaking D-wave”. “The NSA began pouring money into quantum 
computing, which up to then had been an obscure idea viewed mainly as a thought experiment, 
and it was soon joined by other agencies in the Department of Defense.” (Hutchinson 6) Aside 
from funding quantum computers the NSA and government are purchasing experimental 
quantum cryptographic devices from id Quantique in Geneva and MagiQ in New York City from 
the research done at IBM. In the article “Best-Kept Secrets” written by Gary Stix he explains the 
following “The National Security Agency or one of the Federal Reserve banks can now buy a 
quantum-cryptographic system from two small companies—and more products are on the way.” 
(Stix 3) In any case it seems like quantum computers are moving more out of theory into real 
world working applications.
 The technology to build quantum computers is becoming more evident. The quantum 
computers prototypes that are being built by D-wave are cooled to sub freezing temperatures in 
order to operate. In the article “Quantum Leap” written by Lev Grossman, Lev writes “Inside is a 
cylindrical cooling apparatus containing a niobium computer chip that's been chilled to around 
20 millikelvins, which, in case you're not used to measuring temperature in millikelvins, is about 
-459.6°F, almost 2° colder than the Boomerang Nebula.” (Grossman 3) Over the course of about 
15 years the prototypes being tested and designed by D-Wave are getting more efficient and 
more powerful. Lev Grossman writes in the article “Quantum Leap” the following “In 2007 D-
Wave publicly demonstrated a 16-qubit adiabatic quantum computer. By 2011 it had built (and 
sold to Lockheed Martin) the D-Wave One, with 128 qubits. In 2013 it unveiled the 512-qubit D-
Wave Two.” (Grossman 23) The chip in the current working prototype is capable of performing 
a couple of thousand quantum operations all at the same time. In the article “Quantum Leap” Lev 
Grossman explains in further detail the following “The supercooled niobium chip at the heart of 
the D-Wave Two has 512 qubits and therefore could in theory perform 2512 operations 
simultaneously.” (Grossman 13) Then again D-wave is not the only company racing to build 
powerful quantum computers. Companies and universities are investing a lot of resources into it. 
In Lev Grossman’s article “Quantum Leap” Lev points out the following “But D-Wave won't 
have the field to itself forever. IBM has its own quantum-computing group; Microsoft has two. 
There are dozens of academic laboratories busily pushing the envelope, all in pursuit of the 
computational equivalent of splitting the atom.” (Grossman 39) Quantum computers have been 
thought experiments since physicists started to ponder about applying quantum physics to 
classical computers. In the article “Quantum Leap” written by Lev Grossman Lev reveals the 
following “The modern computing era began in the 1930s, with the work of Alan Turing, but it 
wasn't until the 1980s that the famously eccentric Nobel laureate Richard Feynman began 
kicking around questions like: What would happen if we built a computer that operated under 
quantum rules instead of classical ones? Could it be done? And if so, how? More important, 
would there be any point?” (Grossman 9) At any rate the technology for quantum computers is 
getting more apparent in the last 20 years. 
Quantum computers will solve problems with artificial intelligence, medicine, physics, 
and space but it might create more problems in terms of how information is secured. Current 
encryption standards will change with classical computers due to quantum encryption. All in all 
quantum computers will make advancements in science and technology. Scientists will be able to 
model better medicine in simulations and solve sets of data more efficiently. It will enhance 
image recognition technology to detect tumors from medical data or to help make smart 
decisions like detecting if there is a bomb in a security scan. In any case it should help scientists 
to solve a lot of difficult problems in different fields of science. Quantum computers will 
probably be used to do things more accurately like protein folding and designing computer code 
with less bugs. Computers started as large assemblies of switches and vacuum tubes which 
would encompass entire rooms and they got more and more advanced to where the same 
capabilities would fit on the face of a dime.  In any event computer technology will continue to 
develop. Our society uses the modern computer for everything from transportation to
communication. Almost every modern device depends on computer technology in some sense. 
Technology that depends on computers will grow, evolve and get smarter. Classical computers 
over the next few decades will seem outdated and as sluggish as a primitive abacus with the 
advent of quantum computing taking its place. Quantum computers will usher in a new form of 
standards used in classical computers and classical computers will be reinvented and made anew. 
In any event there are always problems that arise from new technology and tools. Classical 
computers have changed the world in a sense even though computers are used to solve a lot of 
problems in science they have made new problems. Hopefully with the reinvention and 
improvement in computer technology that quantum computers are going to bring to people our 
problems will be more easily recognizable. Quantum computers have moved from thought 
experiments to semi working prototypes after decades of scientific speculation and anticipation. 
Recently companies have been investing and focusing more energy, time and money on trying to 
build and develop a working prototype. Quantum computer prototypes currently only possess 
doing quantum applications in terms of a few hundred qubits but scientists will make and build 
stronger quantum computers capable of having thousands or millions of qubits of processing 
power. Either way the first working prototypes are functioning and scientists will continue to 
develop and harness the technology to make more powerful quantum computers. In a simple 
summary I think quantum computers will help make important scientific and technological 
realizations that will benefit scientists who are trying to solve difficult problems.
