quantum go model qbit model

todo -> to refine this idea, was just drawn quickly,
( a thought model for the standard computing "die" to show the states of on/off at the same time , on/on, off/off, and the superposition to model quantum computing through standard over the counter electronics using opto-isolators and mosfets, to retain the position of ON and OFF at the same time as the Qubit model allows)




maybe through other refinement, current quantum computer processors similar to google's quantum cpu (QPU)
https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/news/Quantum-record-HECC-nodes/, could be modeled directly in software similar to QEMU being able to emulate a fully functioning intel core 2 duo,

nothing prevents a software emulation model like QEMU from emulating a quantum cpu,

at a basic level beyond basic logic gates AND, XOR, NAND gates,

quantum functions can / could be represented by on and off at the same time as 1 and 0 in symbolic logic, similar to binary on (1) and off (0) (referencing a qubit in the state of a quantum super position)
