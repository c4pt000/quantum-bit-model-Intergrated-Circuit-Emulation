quantum go model qbit model

todo -> to refine this idea, was just drawn quickly,
( a thought model for the standard computing "die" to show the states of on/off at the same time , on/on, off/off, and the superposition to model quantum computing through standard over the counter electronics using opto-isolators and mosfets, to retain the position of ON and OFF at the same time as the Qubit model allows)




IBM could be back with avengeance

* other thoughts a screensaver which would use hardened "rorscach models"
