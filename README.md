# orginially posted for the hopes of silicon "die" quantum computers to already use silicon fabrication to make quantum cpus

* not overly expensive ridiculous contraptions that spin atoms around........ but just regular old everyday silicon chips that use a qubit style mathematical logic to bind BITs as 1s and 0s and paired 10s and to emulate working qubits

todo -> to refine this idea, was just drawn quickly,
( a thought model for the standard computing "die" to show the states of on/off at the same time , on/on, off/off, and the superposition to model quantum computing through standard over the counter electronics using opto-isolators and mosfets, to retain the position of ON and OFF at the same time as the Qubit model allows)


# google should, model sycamore google's quantum cpu for KVM or intel should model horse ridge for a virtualized KVM QPU model

https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-introduces-horse-ridge-enable-commercially-viable-quantum-computers/#gs.pz5suw

maybe through other refinement, current quantum computer processors similar to google's quantum cpu (QPU)
https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/news/Quantum-record-HECC-nodes/, could be modeled directly in software similar to QEMU being able to emulate a fully functioning intel core 2 duo,

nothing prevents a software emulation model like QEMU from emulating a quantum cpu,

at a basic level beyond basic logic gates AND, XOR, NAND gates,

quantum functions can / could be represented by on and off at the same time as 1 and 0 in symbolic logic, similar to binary on (1) and off (0) (referencing a qubit in the state of a quantum super position)
